# 1000 Days of Code Challenge 💻

I’m starting my 1000 Days of Code journey.

I will code every day and document what I learn.

## Goals
- Improve problem solving
- Become a Full-Stack developer
- Build real proj

---
# Day 2 

I’m continuing my 1000 Days of Code journey.

Today’s Progress

Learned more about References in C++
Practiced modifying variables directly using references

* Built a mini Bank System that:
- Searches for a client using the account number
- Shows client information if found
- Asks the user if they want to update the client data
- Updates the original client object using references

# Day 3

Continuing my 1000 Days of Code journey.

Today’s Progress:
- Focused on applying my previous C++ knowledge to my Bank System project.
- The project is completely built by me from scratch:
     - A console-based Bank System to add, update, delete, and search for clients.
     - Handles data safely with files and struct objects.
     - Includes safe deletion using MarkForDelete and formatted console output.
     - 
- Today’s challenge:
     - Fixed a loop/bug when searching for a client caused by input buffer issues.
     - Used getline(cin >> ws, ...) to handle input correctly and prevent infinite loops.

Challenge
- Practiced debugging and applying existing concepts to solve real problems.
- Reinforced the importance of careful input handling and testing in console applications.
